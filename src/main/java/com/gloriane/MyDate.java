/*
Your MyDate class looks great! It has the required functionality for comparing dates (isBefore) and converting them to a string format (toString). Here’s a quick review of the code:

Constructor:

The constructor initializes the day, month, and year fields. This is good practice.

isBefore Method:

This method compares two MyDate objects and returns true if the current date (this) is before the other date. The logic is sound for comparing year, month, and day in sequence.

toString Method:

The toString method returns the date in day/month/year format. This is clear and readable.

Suggestions for Improvement
Input Validation:

You might want to add some validation to ensure that the day, month, and year values are within valid ranges. For example, check that the month is between 1 and 12, and the day is valid for the specified month and year.

equalsMethod:

If you plan to compare two MyDate objects for equality, you can override the equals method to make the comparison clearer and more efficient.

Here’s a version with the improvements:

java
Copy
Edit
public class MyDate {
    private int day;
    private int month;
    private int year;

    public MyDate(int day, int month, int year) {
        if (month < 1 || month > 12) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Month must be between 1 and 12.");
        }
        if (day < 1 || day > 31) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Day must be between 1 and 31.");
        }
        // Additional validation could be added for days in each month, leap years, etc.
        this.day = day;
        this.month = month;
        this.year = year;
    }

    public boolean isBefore(MyDate other) {
        if (this.year < other.year) return true;
        if (this.year == other.year && this.month < other.month) return true;
        if (this.year == other.year && this.month == other.month && this.day < other.day) return true;
        return false;
    }

    public String toString() {
        return day + "/" + month + "/" + year;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object obj) {
        if (this == obj) return true;
        if (obj == null || getClass() != obj.getClass()) return false;
        MyDate myDate = (MyDate) obj;
        return day == myDate.day && month == myDate.month && year == myDate.year;
    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        return 31 * (31 * year + month) + day;
    }
}
Additional Features:
Validation for Date:

Added basic validation for month and day. You might want to enhance this by checking the actual number of days in each month and handling leap years.

equals and hashCode Methods:

These methods are overridden so you can directly compare two MyDate objects using equals() and handle collections properly (like using MyDate in HashSet or HashMap).

Let me know if you need any further modifications or explanations!
